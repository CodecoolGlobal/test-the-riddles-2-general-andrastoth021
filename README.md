### Environment Variables
You need to set a few environment variables for the automated tests.
- Firstly create a `.env` file in the root folder (where `.gitignore` and `pom.xml` are).
- Secondly copy the code below into the newly created `.env` file.
- Thirdly provide variables for your `.env` file.

```
REPTILE_USER_USERNAME=
REPTILE_USER_EMAIL=
REPTILE_USER_PASSWORD=

REPTILE_QUIZMASTER_USERNAME=
REPTILE_QUIZMASTER_EMAIL=
REPTILE_QUIZMASTER_PASSWORD=
```
